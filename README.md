Comic book inventory app.
 This App is to assist comic book collectors keep
 inventory of their collected comic books. Also, the collectors will
 keep tabs on their monthly pull list. Not sure if there is a API that may
 help with sending indications when books are available. It does need to 
 be corrected for man issues. It should also consider the 
 collectors may have mostly graphic novels or trade paper back
 formatted books. 

 The app is also intended to display collections remotely to others users
 online. Someone else suggesting adding the ability to buy, sell, and trade books.
